### ***About The Mod***
Bagek's Equiney Add-On *{BEAOM}* is a mod that is both an addon and its own mod. It brings more variety of new tack for SWEM horses. 

*All* tack and *most* items/blocks in this mod will be eventually crafted using either Sunburst, Equium or Coralarite, which can be found in caves, creative mode or loot chests.
All items will be able to be crafted and available to view in JEI.

This mod will be created for 1.18.2, 1.20.1, and 1.16.5.

Besides the new tack the equiney add-on will have side mods like;

♞ Bagek's Model Mod **In progress**
♞ Bagek's Coat Add-On **Available**
♞ Bagek's Decoration Mod In **progress**
